# Slide Keyboard

Android custom keyboard featuring a swipe input method.

## Compact layout

Each key holds up to 4 different characters, which are written by swiping in the corresponding direction.
Single touch inputs the background number, and long pressing shows alternative characters for each key.
Swiping up or down on the shift key triggers caps!
